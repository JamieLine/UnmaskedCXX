Parser -> A class which takes in a file path, and outputs the useful test data somehow (this was written before Parser)
MicroParsers -> A collection of functions which parse the data out of a meaningfully large segment (e.g. AcceptUnmaskedPredicateTest)
Acceptors -> A collection of functions which parse the smallest fragments, which are in some sense devoid of meaning on their own (e.g AcceptNonSpecialCharToken, AcceptIndexValuePair)

Parser-fragment is a generic term for a MicroParser or an Acceptor

As a rough rule, a Parser does the whole job
A MicroParser does some useful segment of a job which has a clear goal
An Acceptor does some repeated or nameable segment which has no clear goal

Each parser or parser-fragment is expected to move the iterator it gets as an argument by reference
